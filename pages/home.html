            <h2>More customization. More speed. Just as simple.</h2>
            <p>
                People loved Version 1.0, and there's even more to love in 2.0. We've rebuilt it using AngularJS which has allowed us to add more customization options such as <b>custom themes</b>, <b>drag & drop to reorder items</b>, <b>the ability to change section headers</b>, and <b>support for more devices</b>.

                <p>
                    Yes! When you want to save your data, go to the <a href="/#/personal">generate</a> page and click the <i>Save Data</i> button. Next time you come back, we will automatically ask if you want to load it!

                <h3>Do you save/sell the personal information I enter/save?</h3>
                <p>
                    No way. Nobody but you has access to the information you enter here. It is only saved on your own computer using local storage. That means if you want to come back and edit it later, you must be using the same browser and computer, and don't clear your cache or you'll lose everything.

                <h3>Can I download my resume as a Word document?</h3>
                <p>
                    No, not at the moment. We are working on figuring out a method to export the resume as a Word document, but for now, only PDF is supported.
